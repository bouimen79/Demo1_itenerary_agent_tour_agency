# 🧭 AI Itinerary Agent Demo for Tour Agencies

This project is a demonstration of an **AI-powered itinerary planning agent** designed for use by tour agencies or travel platforms. The notebook showcases how large language models (LLMs) can automate the process of creating personalized travel plans based on user preferences.

## 📌 Overview

The itinerary agent interacts with users through natural language, understands their travel needs (destination, trip duration, interests, etc.), and returns a structured multi-day itinerary. It's an example of how generative AI can streamline operations in the tourism industry.

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 Uses LLMs to interpret user input and generate plans
- 🗓️ Outputs structured day-by-day travel itineraries
- 🔁 Easy to customize for different destinations and travel styles
- 🛠️ Potential for integration with APIs, booking platforms, or front-end apps
