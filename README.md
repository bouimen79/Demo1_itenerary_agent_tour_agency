# 🧭 AI Itinerary Agent Demo for Tour Agencies

This project is a demonstration of an **AI-powered itinerary planning agent** designed for use by tour agencies or travel platforms. The notebook showcases how large language models (LLMs) can automate the process of creating personalized travel plans based on user preferences.

## 📌 Overview

The itinerary agent interacts with users through natural language, understands their travel needs (destination, trip duration, interests, etc.), and returns a structured multi-day itinerary. It's an example of how generative AI can streamline operations in the tourism industry.

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 Uses LLMs to interpret user input and generate plans
- 🗓️ Outputs structured day-by-day travel itineraries
- 🔁 Easy to customize for different destinations and travel styles
- 🛠️ Potential for integration with APIs, booking platforms, or front-end apps

## 📂 Contents

- `Demo1_itenerary_agent_tour_agency_.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the core AI itinerary agent logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI API key (if using GPT-based models) or using cohere api key 
- Optional: `langchain`, `openai`, `pandas`, `ipython`, etc.
